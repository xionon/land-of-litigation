This is a VERY OLD game I made, back in 2005.  It was my first PHP project ever!

I made this for CS 4-something, Distributed Systems.  The project was pretty open ended, we had to "propose, design, and make a dynamic web page."  Over about 5 weeks, this is what I came up with (while simultaniously teaching myself PHP, mysql, and programming in general).  I got an A.

It's pretty horrible.  I've had dreams of fixing it up for some time now.  Let's see what happens.
