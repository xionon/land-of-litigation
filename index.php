Recently, however, there has been stryfe.  The Robots have broken the fragile peace!  Oh no!  The Ninjas, who are obviously closely related to Robots, are furious.  They demand retribution!  Not to be left out of a good party, the Pirates join the Ninjas in their crusade.  The Zombies are pissed, too, because the robots keep killing things with Brains, and the Zombies want to eat the Brains, but the Robots won't let them, because they need the Brains for their Experaments.</p><p>Join one of the three factions: the Zombies, the Pirates, or the Ninjas; crusade against the enemies of the Land of Litigation: the Robots, and maybe some other stupid things; earn pointless experience points and do random Quests for dumb Sages.  The Land of Litigation is yours to explore.  At least until my mySQL account is deleted.</p></div></body></html>
