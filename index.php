	    <p>The story thus far...</p>
	    <p>For many years, Robots, Ninjas, Pirates and Zombies lived in relative peace in the Land of Litigation.  Recently, however, there has been stryfe.
	      The Robots have broken the fragile peace!  Oh no!  The Ninjas, who are obviously closely related to Robots, are furious.  They demand retribution!
	      Not to be left out of a good party, the Pirates join the Ninjas in their crusade. The Zombies are pissed, too, because the robots keep killing 
	      things with Brains, and the Zombies want to eat the Brains, but the Robots won't let them, because they need the Brains for their Experaments.</p>
	    <p>Join one of the three factions: the Zombies, the Pirates, or the Ninjas; crusade against the enemies of the Land of Litigation: the Robots, and 
	    maybe some other stupid things; earn pointless experience points and do random Quests for dumb Sages. The Land of Litigation is yours to explore.
	    At least until my mySQL account is deleted.</p>

	    <ul>
			<li><strong>12-10-05</strong><br/>
			Been a while since I've made any updates, mostly because I've been busy with the last few weeks of school. 			Changed: a bit of balance.  Made classes stronger to start out, so that it's not so insanely difficult to beat 			one regular goblin.  Added: random chance to recieve an item from a monster.  Fixed: equipping bug (I think...).			Fixed: prices of items no longer go up as you level up ;-).		</li>
			<li><strong>12-1-05</strong><br/>
			Fixed that damn log-back-in bug that has plauged me since I started this thing.          I'm not really sure WHAT the problem was, but damn it, I HACKED MY WAY AROUND IT.</li>
